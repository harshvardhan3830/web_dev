# Array and Object Questions with Loop Patterns

1. **Create an array of 10 numbers. Print all even numbers using a `for` loop.**
2. **Given an array of strings, print each string in reverse order using a `for...of` loop.**
3. **Create an object representing a student with properties: name, age, and grades (an array). Print each grade using a `for` loop.**
4. **Given an array of objects representing books (with title and author), print the title of each book using a `forEach` loop.**
5. **Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum using a `while` loop.**
6. **Given an array of numbers, print only the numbers greater than 50 using a `for` loop.**
7. **Create an array of 5 objects representing employees (name, department). Print the names of employees in the 'HR' department using a `for...of` loop.**
8. **Given an object with keys as country names and values as populations, print each country and its population using a `for...in` loop.**
9. **Write a function that takes an array of strings and prints only those with length greater than 5 using a `for` loop.**
10. **Given an array of numbers, create a new array with each number squared using a `for` loop.**
11. **Create an object with 3 properties. Use a `for...in` loop to print all property names and values.**
12. **Given an array of objects representing products (name, price), print the names of products with price less than 100 using a `forEach` loop.**
13. **Write a function that takes an array and prints its elements in reverse order using a `while` loop.**
14. **Given an array of numbers, print the index and value of each element using a `for` loop.**
15. **Create an array of 5 numbers. Use a `for...of` loop to print the double of each number.**
16. **Given an object with student names as keys and marks as values, print the names of students who scored above 80 using a `for...in` loop.**
17. **Write a function that takes an array of objects (with `name` and `age`) and prints the names of people older than 18 using a `for` loop.**
18. **Given an array of strings, print only those that start with the letter 'A' using a `forEach` loop.**
19. **Create an array of numbers. Use a `for` loop to print the sum of all odd numbers.**
20. **Given an object representing a car (make, model, year), use a `for...in` loop to print each property and its value.**
